1. Can we use npm with React or do we have to use yarn?

## Both. We can use npm to install React then yarn to fetch dependencies. (found by searching both npm and yarn from within the docs)

2. We are using JSX to write HTML inside of our React. Are we required to use JSX with React? Are there any alternatives?

## No. We could also use plain JavaScript with DOM manipulation, but it is not recommended. (found by searching JSX from within the docs and following any accompanying links)

3. Does React re-render the entire component when one part of it changes?

## No, and that's what makes React so powerful; it helps create a more fluid interactive experience. (found in my memory of Daniel's lecture)

4. Should we ever change props (or parameters) inside of a component?

## Typically no, unless we are using 'state' (src= https://reactjs.org/docs/components-and-props.html#props-are-read-only )

5. Are all components classes?

## No, components can also be simple functions. (found by searching components from within the docs)

6. List five "Synthetic Events" provided by React:

   ### Clipboard Events
   ### Composition Events
   ### Keyboard Events
   ### Focus Events
   ### Form Events

## (found by searching 'syntheticevents' from within the docs)

7. Where can I go to check out React's built-in Accessibility features?

## https://reactjs.org/docs/accessibility.html#why-accessibility . (found by searching accessibility from within the docs)
